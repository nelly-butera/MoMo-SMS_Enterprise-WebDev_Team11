## MoMo SMS Data Analytics Dashboard  
**Team Name:** Team 11

### Project Overview
This project is an enterprise-level fullstack application designed to process, clean, analyze, and visualize Mobile Money (MoMo) SMS transaction data provided in XML format.

The system ingests raw MoMo SMS XML data, performs ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, stores structured data in a relational database (SQLite), and exposes insights through a frontend dashboard. The project emphasizes backend data processing, database management, frontend visualization, and collaborative Agile development practices.

This repository represents **Week 1 – Team Setup & Project Planning**, focusing on repository setup, system architecture design, and Scrum workflow organization.


### Objectives
- Parse MoMo SMS data from XML format
- Clean and normalize transaction data (dates, amounts, phone numbers)
- Categorize transactions using rule-based logic
- Store processed data in a relational database
- Prepare data for frontend analytics and visualization
- Practice collaborative development using GitHub and Agile methods
